# Rust-housework
Endless examples for Rust

## Origin
At first there was nothing in this project. There was only endless as well as messy issues. Contributors said, Let there be order: and it was so. And Contributors, looking on the order, saw that it was good: and Contributors made a division between the order and the mess, Naming the order, Answer, and the mess, Issue.

However, the issue is endless, so the answer is endless. The constant creation of answers makes the contributors feel tired. Then, contributors classify the issues and give examples. And Contributors, looking on the examples, saw that it was good.

But, the classification of the issues is as endless as housework. So that the contributors are always pull requests not rest until the end of time.
